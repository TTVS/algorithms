# Algorithms in Java

A collection of algorithms and data structure utility classes, created as self-assigned projects while studing Princeton's online courses Algorithms I, Algorithms II, and Analysis of Algorithms.

## Contents

* **UnionFinder**, a class providing objects for fast `union` and `find` methods using path compression.
* **BinarySearcher**, a class providing a static `search` method that searches a **sorted** array of comparables using binary search.
* **LinkedList** and **DoublyLinkedList** classes providing low-level dynamic collections with methods to add/remove from the start/end of the list, and iterators.
* **Queue** and **Stack** classes, built on top of **LinkedList** with the usual FIFO and LIFO semantics.

## Testing

Run `make test` from the root directory to build the project, build the tests, and run the tests with jUnit.
